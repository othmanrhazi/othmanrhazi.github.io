<p style="text-align: justify;">Financial Analyst, Quantitative Analyst, Moroccan Trader Othman Rhazi was in charge for managing Citibank and Citigroup EMEA' investor products development and expansion in London. He was a representative for the Citigroup commodities division on research progress and build-up R&D. Preceding his move to Citi Rhazi worked as a Sales in Gas and Power desk at EDF. Over the course of his career, he has directly served in more than 100+ Venture Capital & Private Equity Investments and contributed on numerous venture backed start-ups including Facebook, Altiris, HDFC Life, and Rhomobile. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Moreover to fund raising and investment experience, Mr. Rhazi has direct risk-taking and operating understanding, having contributed in multiple start-ups and business missions. Othman Rhazi has used up a countless deal of time inspecting new ways to accomplish his goals since he felt that in order for to be an effective trader he needed to be willing to frequently teach himself and ameliorate his own skills so that he could be a more profitable. A technical trader that is not willing to learn new things and adjust their practices has no business being in the market, Rhazi believed that he is obligated to his teachers to effort to be at the top of his field, mainly Nicole El Karoui, that supported him to work to his plentiful talent.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the 2015, Othman Rhazi decided to discover the world in order to buy low-value businesses and develop them to high end companies. Passionate with the rationalisation of his expenditures, he manages without concerns in reducing costs and raising added value. He began optimising his portfolio in 1999 just at the market collapsed. Later, Mr. Rhazi has continued to increase investment in areas such as transportation and mining. In 2007, he sold his 60% of his shares in an anticipation the market will not move any higher. He then invested all the cash into Gilt, Franc Swiss, and government bonds. It was a resourceful move that saved his hard-earned capital.</p>
